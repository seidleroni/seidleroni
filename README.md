### ðŸ“‚ Portfolio
- Hex Flex [(application)](https://seidleroni.github.io/Hex-Flex-Web/) [(source code)](https://github.com/seidleroni/Hex-Flex-Web)
    - This application is something Iâ€™d been thinking about building for many years. In embedded applications, I work with Intel Hex files all the time, but the best way I was able to view files was by using Segger's J-Flash utility. That tool is okay, but I also wanted a way to compare different hex files. After working with ChatGPT and Gemini, I put this application together. It allows users to view the contents of an Intel Hex file and also compare two different files. When viewing a file, it also shows a map that provides an overview of where data segments are and where memory is blank or erased.
- Pelohard [(site)](https://pelohard.com/)
    - I really love using my Peloton but found it annoying to find classes of appropriate difficulty. This site sorts rides by difficulty and allows users to click on a class and add it to their stack. The project has two parts: first, a Python script that uses my Peloton credentials and the unofficial Peloton REST API to get the 50 most recent rides and save the class information in a JSON file. The second part takes that JSON file and renders the site. The Python script and site automatically update twice a day.
- Library Codabar Barcode Generator [(application)](https://seidleroni.github.io/library-codabar-generator/) [(source code)](https://github.com/seidleroni/library-codabar-generator)
    - My wife and I frequently go to the library to pick up reserved books for ourselves, each other, or our children. Often we need each otherâ€™s library cards, and it was annoying to keep screenshots and dig through photo albums. For fun, I spent about an hour putting this application together, both to solve our problem and to understand barcode formatting better. A user can generate a barcode using the Codabar format used by the Minuteman Library Network (and presumably many other libraries) and add a label. Both the label and card numbers are encoded in the URL, so users can bookmark a specific barcode and view it later.
- Linear Actuator Motion Calculator [(application)](https://seidleroni.github.io/Linear-actuator/) [(source code)](https://github.com/seidleroni/Linear-actuator)
    - I built this tool to help with a work task. I wanted the ability to calculate how long it would take a linear actuator to move a certain distance, given a maximum velocity, acceleration, and deceleration. It also graphs position and velocity over time to provide a clearer picture of what the motor is doing along the way.
