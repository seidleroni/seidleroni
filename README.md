### ðŸ“‚ Portfolio
- Hex Flex [(application)](https://seidleroni.github.io/Hex-Flex-Web/) [(source code)](https://seidleroni.github.io/Hex-Flex-Web/)
    - This application is something I thought about doing for many many years. In embedded applications, I work with Intel Hex files all the time but the best way I as able to view files was to use Segger's J-Flash utility, which is fine. However I wanted a way to compare different hex files together. After working with ChatGPT and Gemini, I was able to put this application together which allows a user to view the contents of an Intel Hex file and also compare two different files. When viewing a file it also shows a map to provide an overview of where data segments are and which segments are blank or erased.
- Pelohard [(site)](https://pelohard.com/)
    - I really love using my Peloton but found it annoying to find classes of appropriate difficulty. This project is comprised of two parts: the first is a Python script that uses my Peloton credentials and the undocumented Peloton REST API to get the 50 most recent rides and save them in a JSON file. The second part of the project takes the JSON file and renders the site using that information. The site sorts the rides by difficulty and allows a user to click on a site and then add it to their class "stack". The Python script automatically runs twice a day.
- Library Codabar Barcode Generator [(application)](https://seidleroni.github.io/library-codabar-generator/) [(source code)](https://github.com/seidleroni/library-codabar-generator)
    - My wife and I frequently go to the library to pick up reserved books, either for ourselves, each other, or our children. Frequently we need each others library cards and we found it annoying to take a screenshot and then root through our photo albums to find each others cards. For fun I spent about an hour putting this application together to both solve our problem but also to understand barcode formatting a bit more. A user can generate the barcode using the codabar format used by the Minuteman Library Network (and presumeably many other libraries) and add a label. Both the label and library numbers are encoded in the URL so the user can bookmark the URL for the barcode they want to save and view it later.
- Linear Actuator Motion Calculator [(application)](https://seidleroni.github.io/Linear-actuator/) [(source code)](https://github.com/seidleroni/Linear-actuator)
    - This was thrown together to assist with something for work. I wanted the ability to determine how long it would take a linear actuator to move a certain distance, given a maximum velocity, acceleration, and deceleration. This also graphs the position and velocity over time to give a better understanding of what the motor is doing along the way.
